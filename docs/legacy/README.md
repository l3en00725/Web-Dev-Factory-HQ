## Web-Dev-Factory Core

This directory contains the core orchestration logic, agents, utilities, and shared data for the Website-Dev-Factory system.

- `core/` — pipeline scripts and master orchestrator logic
- `utils/` — shared helpers (scraping, SEO, file handling, etc.)
- `agents/` — YAML definitions for Cursor/AI agents (schema, content, templates, Astro)
- `skills/` — reusable skills and subroutines for agents
- `data/` — project-level JSON and other structured inputs (branding, SEO, locations)

Implementation will follow the Template System Blueprint in later phases.
