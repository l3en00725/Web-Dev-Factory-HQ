**Q: "What should I do about my brown lawn?"**
**Expert Answer:**
"Let's figure out what's causing the brown spots. Here in Cape May County, common causes include:

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Salt Damage** (common near the coast)
   - Brown patches near driveways or ocean-facing areas
   - Solution: Flush with fresh water, overseed with salt-tolerant grass

2. **Drought Stress** (sandy soil dries fast)
   - Brown, crispy grass; hard soil
   - Solution: Deep watering, organic matter, mulching

3. **Grubs or Pests**
   - Brown patches that pull up like carpet
   - Solution: Pest treatment, beneficial nematodes

4. **Disease** (fungal issues)
   - Circular brown patches, spotted patterns
   - Solution: Fungicide, improve drainage, aeration

5. **Dog Spots**
   - Small, dark brown circles
   - Solution: Water heavily, reseed, train pets

6. **Over-Fertilization**
   - Burnt, straw-colored grass
   - Solution: Flush with water, use slow-release fertilizers

**Quick Assessment:**
📍 Where on your property are the brown spots?
💧 How has watering been?
🐕 Any pets?
🌊 Close to the ocean or driveway?

I can help diagnose the issue or connect you with our team for an in-person assessment.
