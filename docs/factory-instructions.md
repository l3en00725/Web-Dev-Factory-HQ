🏭 Web-Dev-Factory HQ — Official Factory Instructions (MASTER DOCUMENT)
Version: 2025.12 — Authoritative & Enforced

🧠 Purpose of This Document
This is the single source of truth for how every website inside the Web-Dev-Factory HQ ecosystem must be built.
Cursor, all LLM agents, and all human developers must follow these instructions exactly.
This guide ensures:


every build is consistent


no architectural decisions get overwritten


all subsystems behave identically across all client sites


SEO, OG Engine, Structured Data, Forms, CRM, and Dashboard remain unified


tech debt is eliminated


the Factory becomes infinitely scalable


Nothing in this document may be changed unless Benjamin explicitly approves it.
Factory Obedience Rule


Cursor must always load and follow docs/factory-instructions.md before starting or modifying any build.


If anything in this document conflicts with prior rules, this document wins.



🚀 HIGH-LEVEL FACTORY PHASES (0 → 12)
Every site must follow these phases in order:


Phase 0 — Intake Confirmation (Services + Locations)


Phase 1 — Scaffold Site


Phase 2 — Scrape Old Site (optional, default YES)


Phase 3 — Seed Content → Sanity CMS


Phase 4 — Keyword Research → KE API


Phase 4b — SEO Copy Generation


Phase 5 — Template Rendering → Astro Client Base


Phase 5b — Service × Location Page Generation (Mandatory)


Phase 6 — Site Build → Astro


Phase 7 — OG Image Engine


Phase 8 — Structured Data (JSON-LD)


Phase 9 — Forms + CRM Pipeline


Phase 10 — SEO Infrastructure


Phase 11 — Dashboard Registration


Phase 12 — Deploy + Optimize Images


No tool or agent may skip or reorder these phases.

🧾 PHASE 0 — INTAKE CONFIRMATION (MANDATORY BEFORE PHASE 1)
Before anything else happens, Cursor must complete intake confirmation.
✅ Services List (Mandatory)
Cursor must ask:

“List all services you want included. Please confirm this list is final.”

Cursor must:


Display a table of the services


Validate each contains:


title


slug


excerpt


body


isPrimaryService


SEO object


structured data fields




Confirm primary vs secondary classification


Wait for explicit approval:



“Confirmed — proceed.”

✅ Locations List (Mandatory)
Cursor must ask:

“List all locations you want included. Please confirm this list is final.”

Cursor must:


Display a table of locations


Validate each contains:


city


state


description


ZIP (if available)


SEO fields


list of services offered in that location (services[])




Wait for explicit approval:



“Confirmed — proceed.”

No build may begin until both lists are locked and approved.

🏗️ REPO STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
Every site must live inside the following structure:
Web-Dev-Factory-HQ/
  sites/<site-name>/
    data/
      scraped/
    public/
    src/
    .env.local

This structure may never be changed.

📦 SANITY REQUIREMENTS
Sanity must contain the following document types:


settings


homepage


service


location


lead


all PageBuilder section types


Required fields — Service


title


slug


excerpt


body


isPrimaryService (boolean)


SEO object


structured data fields


Required fields — Location


city


state


description


services[]


SEO object


Schema names may never be changed.
Expansions are allowed only with explicit approval.

🔍 SCRAPING REQUIREMENTS
Scraping must only be done using:
bun run scrape --site <site-name> --url <old-domain>

Scraper must output:


pages.json


images.json


site-map.json


service-areas.json


Manual copy/pasting is forbidden.

📝 CONTENT SEEDING REQUIREMENTS
Command:
bun run seed --site <site-name>

Rules:


Map scraped pages → service, location, and homepage content


Never overwrite existing Sanity docs unless explicitly approved


Always generate seed-ready.json


Every page must have SEO fields populated



🔎 KEYWORD RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS
Environment variable:
KEYWORDS_EVERYWHERE_API_KEY=

Rules:


Each service receives a primary keyword


Each location receives location-modified keyword variants


PASF questions must populate FAQ lists


SEO Copy Agent must consume KE data


All results must be saved into keywordResearch object



✍️ SEO COPY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS (Phase 4b)
All SEO copy must:


be 100% unique for each location


contain primary keywords in H1 and meta title


include KE semantic keyword variations


avoid keyword stuffing


be conversational and helpful


🔥 Mandatory Location Variation Rule (40% Minimum)
Every location-based service page must include:


at least 40% unique, location-specific variation


no more than 60% shared content


Variations must be based on:


KE data


local terms


PASF questions


local examples


tone shifts


Cursor must enforce this rule during Phase 4b.

🧩 TEMPLATE RENDERING — ASTRO (Phase 5)
Phase 5 implements all core top-level routes using the client-base template.
It must complete before Phase 5b begins.
Required routes:


/


/services


/services/[slug]


/locations


/locations/[slug]


/contact


/dashboard (SSR only)


All routes must:


pass SEO props


pass structured data


define canonical URLs via seo-utils.ts


Service × Location routing is not handled in Phase 5.
That is handled only in Phase 5b.

⭐ Phase 5b — Service × Location Page Generation (Mandatory)
Every Factory site must automatically generate a dedicated SEO page for every service offered in every location.
Route Format
/locations/<locationSlug>/<serviceSlug>

Requirements for Each Service × Location Page
Each page must:


use base service content as a template


apply 40–60% variation via the variation engine


use location-modified KE keywords


auto-generate PASF FAQs for that service in that location


generate static paths for each valid combination


only include services listed in location.services[]


emit JSON-LD:


LocalBusiness


Service


BreadcrumbList




SEO Rules
Meta Title:
<Service> in <Location>, <State> | <Brand>

H1:
<Location> <Service>

Canonical:
/locations/<locationSlug>/<serviceSlug>

Breadcrumbs:
Home → Locations → <Location> → <Service>

OG Requirements
Each Service × Location page must generate a dynamic OG image using /api/og.


If seo.image exists → use it


Otherwise → build a dynamic OG URL using:


title = “Service in Location”


subtitle = brand name or tagline




Cursor is not allowed to skip Phase 5b under any circumstances.

🎯 Phase 5b Execution Protocol (Cursor Must Follow This)
Cursor must execute Phase 5b in seven atomic micro-steps.
Cursor must stop after each step and must not batch them.
Step 1 — Scaffold Route File (Stop After Completion)
Create:
sites/<site>/src/pages/locations/[location]/[service].astro

Include only:


imports for Base.astro


PageBuilder


SEO utilities


structured data helpers


an empty component shell


Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 2 — getStaticPaths (Stop After Completion)
Implement getStaticPaths to:


fetch all locations from Sanity


for each location, iterate location.services[]


generate static paths:


{ params: { location: <locationSlug>, service: <serviceSlug> } }

Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 3 — Loader / Data Fetching (Stop After Completion)
Implement server-side data fetching to:


load the location document by locationSlug


load the service document by serviceSlug


load global settings


load keywordResearch data (if available)


Return a clean props object to the page.
Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 4 — SEO, Canonical, JSON-LD (Stop After Completion)
Implement:


meta title, description, H1 using the SEO rules above


canonical URL using seo-utils.ts


structured data:


LocalBusiness


Service


BreadcrumbList




All structured data must be cleaned with cleanStructuredData().
Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 5 — Page Content with 40% Variation (Stop After Completion)
Implement content using:


base service content as a template


variationContext with location data:


city, state


local modifiers


KE location-modified keywords




PageBuilder sections adjusted so:


at least 40% of the content is location-specific


no two locations share identical full paragraphs




Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 6 — OG Image Wiring (Stop After Completion)
Implement OG logic:


if seo.image exists → use it


otherwise:


build OG URL via /api/og with:


title: “<Service> in <Location>”


subtitle: brand or tagline






Inject:


og:image


twitter:image


twitter:card


Cursor must stop and wait for confirmation.

Step 7 — Validation + Summary (Final Step)
Cursor must:


validate static path generation count


validate canonical URLs


validate JSON-LD output


validate meta tags


validate that no architectural rules were broken


provide a summary of:


files created


files modified


number of Service × Location pages generated




Then stop. No further changes in Phase 5b.

📸 OG IMAGE ENGINE REQUIREMENTS (Phase 7)
Route:
/api/og

Rules:


must generate dynamic 1200×630 images


must pull brand colors and logo from Sanity


if seo.image exists → override dynamic OG


otherwise → auto-generate



🧱 STRUCTURED DATA REQUIREMENTS (Phase 8)
Each page must emit JSON-LD:


Homepage → Organization


Service → Service + BreadcrumbList


Location → LocalBusiness + BreadcrumbList


Service × Location → LocalBusiness + Service + BreadcrumbList


All structured data must be cleaned via:
cleanStructuredData()


📨 FORMS + CRM REQUIREMENTS (Phase 9)
Route:
/api/forms/contact

Pipeline:


create lead document in Sanity


forward submission to:


email


webhook


Jobber (future)




patch status after forwarding


Requires:
SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN=


🧭 SEO INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS (Phase 10)
Must include:


/sitemap-index.xml


/robots.txt (with staging detection)


redirect map generator


canonical URL logic


custom 404 page


optional 410 endpoint


Redirects:
bun run generate-redirects --site <site-name>


📊 CENTRAL DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS (Phase 11)
Site must auto-register:
bun run register-dashboard --site <site-name>

This must write:


DASHBOARD_UUID=


DASHBOARD_API_URL=


Dashboard must display:


analytics status


keyword insights


leads


site health


Dashboard route must be SSR only.

🖼️ DEPLOY + IMAGE OPTIMIZATION (Phase 12)


Ensure scripts/optimize-images.mjs has been run for legacy images


Confirm WebP/AVIF output where applicable


Confirm no oversized assets are shipped in production
