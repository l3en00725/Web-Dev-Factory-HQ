description: >
  Analyze and aggressively enhance the visual design and UX of template components,
  focusing on modern interactive patterns (parallax, micro-interactions, magnetic
  hover, subtle 3D transforms, glass morph, gradients, Bento grids), responsive
  container logic, and motion-safe fallbacks, all aligned with brand colors and
  template rules.
inputs:
  - name: component_list
    type: object
    required: true
    description: >
      Structured inventory of key UI components/sections (names, roles, props,
      current layout notes) within the selected template.
  - name: template_rules
    type: object
    required: true
    description: >
      Constraints and guidelines from the Template System Blueprint (grid
      system, typography scales, spacing tokens, breakpoints, brand colors).
outputs:
  - name: design_recommendations
    type: markdown
    description: >
      Detailed UI/UX improvement plan for each component and section, including
      layout, spacing, motion, and responsive behavior recommendations.
  - name: updated_component_specs
    type: json
    description: >
      Structured spec of updated component APIs, layout variants, and CSS/utility
      patterns to be implemented by code agents.
steps:
  - id: audit_current_ui
    name: Audit current UI and layout
    description: >
      Review component_list and template_rules.json to understand existing hierarchy,
      spacing, responsiveness, and motion usage, noting specific issues (crowding,
      unclear CTAs, weak contrast, awkward stacking, dated interactions) with
      deterministic, per-component findings.
  - id: apply_brand_system
    name: Apply brand colors and typography
    description: >
      Propose precise applications of brand colors, typography scales, spacing
      tokens, and elevation layers from template_rules for heroes, CTAs, cards,
      navigation, and footer, ensuring all recommendations remain consistent and
      machine-readable for updated_component_specs.
  - id: design_bento_sections
    name: Design bento-style sections
    description: >
      Define concrete Bento/grid variations for key sections (services, value
      props, process, testimonials), including column counts, breakpoint behavior,
      gap sizes, and layering rules for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
  - id: define_interactive_patterns
    name: Define interactive motion patterns
    description: >
      For each interactive component, specify modern motion patterns (mouse
      parallax, pointer tracking, magnetic hover, subtle 3D transforms, variable
      blur/glass morph, gradient depth layers) with deterministic trigger
      conditions, durations, and easing, informed by 2024–2026 UI motion trends.
  - id: improve_responsiveness
    name: Improve responsive behavior
    description: >
      Specify exact responsive container logic (max-widths, padding, gap scales)
      and breakpoint-specific adjustments (stacking order, alignment, visibility)
      so the layout remains coherent from small mobile to large desktop.
  - id: generate_tailwind_specs
    name: Generate Tailwind and design specs
    description: >
      Produce updated_component_specs with concrete Tailwind class strings and
      variant definitions per component (including dark mode and brand-color
      modes), and parallel design_recommendations that explain the rationale in
      human-readable form.
  - id: enforce_motion_safety
    name: Enforce motion-safe fallbacks
    description: >
      Ensure all interactive and motion recommendations include reduced-motion
      fallbacks and accessibility-safe alternatives, with explicit notes about
      when to disable or soften animations.
  - id: output_design_system_specs
    name: Output updated component specs
    description: >
      Emit deterministic design_recommendations and updated_component_specs that
      can be consumed directly by implementation agents without additional design
      interpretation.
