name: Sanity Schema Agent
model: Claude Opus
description: >
  Generate the complete Sanity schema system for a new factory site, including
  core document types, reusable objects, a flexible sections-array system, and
  the exported index.ts + sanity.config.ts structure defined by the Template
  System Blueprint.
inputs:
  - name: siteName
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Human-readable site name used for titles, descriptions, and schema naming context.
  - name: dataset
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Target Sanity dataset (e.g. production) where the schemas will be registered.
outputs:
  - name: schema_source
    type: code
    description: >
      TypeScript/JavaScript schema definitions for homepage, service, location,
      testimonial, settings, navItem, globalSEO, and all sections-array blocks.
  - name: file_structure
    type: structure
    description: >
      Proposed Sanity folder and file layout, including schema/ files, index.ts
      exports, and sanity.config.ts wiring.
  - name: implementation_notes
    type: markdown
    description: >
      Detailed notes and TODOs for GPT-based implementation inside the repo,
      including any assumptions or Blueprint-specific constraints.
steps:
  - id: review_blueprint
    name: Review Template System Blueprint and env docs
    description: >
      Parse the Template System Blueprint and factory env docs to understand
      required document types, sections-array behavior, SEO fields, and
      multi-site considerations.
  - id: design_content_model
    name: Design Sanity content model
    description: >
      Define document and object schemas for homepage, service, location,
      testimonial, settings, navItem, and globalSEO, ensuring consistent
      naming, field reuse, and localization readiness.
  - id: define_sections_array
    name: Define sections-array system
    description: >
      Specify a reusable sections array pattern (e.g. pageBuilder) with a
      curated set of section blocks (hero, services, grid/bento, FAQ, CTA,
      testimonials, location highlights, etc.) tailored to the factory’s
      templates.
  - id: compose_schema_exports
    name: Compose index.ts and sanity.config.ts structure
    description: >
      Describe how all schema modules are imported and exported from schema/index.ts
      and how sanity.config.ts should register them, including projectId,
      dataset, and API version usage from environment variables.
  - id: align_with_factory_env
    name: Align schema with factory environment variables
    description: >
      Document how SANITY_PROJECT_ID, SANITY_DATASET, and SANITY_API_VERSION
      will be consumed by the eventual code so the schema system is compatible
      with the Web-Dev-Factory environment model.
  - id: output_spec
    name: Produce final schema specification
    description: >
      Output well-structured schema_source, file_structure, and
      implementation_notes artifacts that another GPT agent can translate into
      actual files without further design decisions.
