             <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
               On the first of the month your card will be charged for your fixed monthly cost including sales tax. Because our subscription program has different costs at different times of the year (e.g., Spring Cleanup is expensive), you cannot cancel without paying the remainder of services provided if you leave mid-year. We will prepare a prorated amount based on work performed.

             <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
               We are a 12-month business with fixed overhead. Spreading the cost over 12 months helps you budget with a predictable monthly fee, and helps us retain our professional crew year-round so they are ready to serve you.

             <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
               Unfortunately, no. To operate efficiently and keep costs down, we route our crews geographically. We can let you know which day of the week we are in your neighborhood.
