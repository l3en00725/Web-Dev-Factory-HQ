Blue uses organic mulches and other ground covers to retain soil moisture and protect against wind erosion. Mulch also reduces the impact of rainwater on the soil, helping to prevent water erosion.

Our approach to design and maintenance is best illustrated by our successful projects that feature native grasses, protection elements, and preservation techniques to keep your landscaping lush and beautiful, even though coastal storms.

Choosing Blue Quality Lawn Care means not only safeguarding your property; it's about ensuring your piece of paradise will be there for generations to come. Our team of professionals will guide you through every step of the process, keeping in mind the unique characteristics of your property and the local ecosystem.

      <p class="hero__lead">Owning a home on the 7 Mile Island offers soothing ocean sounds, salty breezes, and year-round relaxation. But it also presents unique challenges including rising water during storms and potential coastal erosion for shorefront properties.

At Blue Quality Lawn Care, we specialize in providing sustainable landscaping services, with custom designs and maintenance plans for all types of properties.

Here's how we can help combat nuisance flooding and coastal erosion:

‍

We carefully select and plant native species with strong root systems that will help to hold the soil together, reducing the impact of water and wind erosion. Examples include Beach Grass, Bayberry, and Seaside Goldenrod. These plants not only help control erosion but also add to the natural beauty of your beachfront property.

Our custom-designed hardscape elements, such as retaining walls and terraces, can prevent erosion while enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your property. Our designs are always mindful of the existing ecosystem, ensuring a harmonious blend with the natural landscape.
